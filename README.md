## Find commits that introduced swearwords
You noticed that your project contains swearwords. You don't want to remove them in the next commit as your boss might
someday find out that they were present in the codebase (he haven't spotted them yet).

Find all commits that add *shit* word and change them so they introduce *flower* instead.
